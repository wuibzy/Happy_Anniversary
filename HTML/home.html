            Hi Mia, baby, bai, my love. If you’re reading this then it’s our first anniversary. I can’t express how much joy I have in writing this, if I were to tell you this in person I would probably cry, but I love you. These here are my favourite moments and core memories of us together. It’s not quite the traditional handmade gifts you crave but I hope you see that yes, typing on a keyboard could still be considered handmade hehe. 

The past few months have been tough for the both of us but I hope we come out of it stronger than ever. You’re the girl I love the most, the only girl I’ve loved deeply, and I am ready to do anything just so you can feel that love, as I said, you’re worth it. I love you then, I love you now, and I’ll love you tomorrow. Even with the pain I felt these past months, I can still gladly say that I’d do it all over again if it meant to experience those moments again with you. 

Before, I told you that you brought sunshine to my moody dark world, it still holds true to this day. I’m always anticipating your messages full of thought and jejemonness, or when class ends so that I can see your beautiful face and hear your sweet voice. You keep me motivated in school no doubt about it, and I hope I do the same to you. Even in those quiet days where we don’t talk much or don’t even talk at all, I still think of how much I love you and how lucky I am to be yours and you to be mine. You’re the sweetest, kindest, thoughtful, and caring girl I’ve ever met. Not only that, you're smart, diligent, responsible, and practical. You have a way of thinking that just makes things work. All of this culminates to the reason why I fell in love with you.

You’ve made me feel so loved, love that’s hard to find. So I whole heartedly, as genuine as I can be, thank you for everything and I hope you like what I’ve made for you. I love you as always in all ways. 

- Marrence
